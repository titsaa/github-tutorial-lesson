# How to Configure SSH for your Github Account
## Step 1: Check if You Have an SSH Key
First, check if you have an existing SSH key on your local machine:

bash
Copy code
ls -al ~/.ssh
Look for files named id_rsa and id_rsa.pub (or similar). If these files are missing, you’ll need to generate a new SSH key.

## Step 2: Generate an SSH Key (if necessary)
If you don’t have an SSH key, generate one:

bash
Copy code
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Press Enter to accept the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa) and passphrase (optional).

## Step 3: Add Your SSH Key to the SSH Agent
Start the SSH agent in the background and add your SSH key to it:

bash
Copy code
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

## Step 4: Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account
Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:

bash
Copy code
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Go to GitHub, log in, and navigate to Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key. Paste your SSH key there and save it.

## Step 5: Test the SSH Connection to GitHub
To ensure your SSH key is correctly set up, test the connection to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
ssh -T git@github.com
If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message like:

vbnet
Copy code
Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
# Step 6: Try Cloning/Accessing the Repository Again
Now, try cloning the repository or performing the action that triggered the error:

bash
Copy code
git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
Additional Troubleshooting
Check SSH Config: Ensure that your SSH config file (~/.ssh/config) does not have incorrect settings that might override your key.
Check Repository URL: Ensure that the repository URL is correct and you have access to it.
Access Rights: Confirm that your GitHub account has the necessary permissions to access the repository.
These steps should resolve the Permission denied (publickey) error and allow you to interact with your GitHub repositories via SSH.
